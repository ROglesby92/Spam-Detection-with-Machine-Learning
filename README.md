# Spam-detection-with-Neural-Networks
Implementing a simple Neural Network to train on data collected from spam emails.


The test data is about 4601 lists of data, containing values ranging from all over based of various statistics such as number of words, number of unigram words , longest word, shortest word, etc.

We need to first extract the max and minimum values of each attritubte for each list in the training set and normalize the values between 0 and 1 for our network to work.

Once this is done we can learn and propigate to good levels of confidence!

Running the program we will get some results as so..
